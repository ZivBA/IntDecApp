# Documentation Structure

This directory contains all project documentation organized by purpose.

## Structure

- **`architecture/`** - System architecture, design decisions, and technical specifications
- **`research/`** - Research findings, algorithm evaluations, and technical analysis
- **`implementation/`** - Implementation strategy, development plans, and technical roadmaps
- **`tasks/`** - Task definitions, status tracking, and progress monitoring

## Document Flow

1. **Research** → Technical findings and algorithm analysis
2. **Architecture** → System design and technical specifications based on research
3. **Implementation** → Strategic development plan derived from architecture
4. **Tasks** → Specific implementation tasks with detailed status tracking

## Maintenance Guidelines

- Keep documents up to date with implementation changes
- Reference related documents using relative links
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Archive outdated documents rather than deleting them

# Photo Capture Guide for 3D Room Reconstruction

*For interior designers using the 3D reconstruction app*

## Quick Start: The "20-Photo Circle" Method

### Basic Technique
1. **Stand in room center** - Pick a spot where you can see most of the room
2. **Take 20 photos in a circle** - Turn 18° between each shot (360°/20 = 18°)  
3. **Keep phone at eye level** - Don't tilt up/down dramatically
4. **Overlap is critical** - Each photo should share 70% content with the next

### Specific Instructions

#### Phone Position
- **Height**: Eye level (5.5-6 feet from floor)
- **Orientation**: Hold phone horizontally (landscape mode)
- **Distance**: 2-3 feet from room center
- **Angle**: Point slightly toward room center, not walls

#### Photo Sequence
```
Photo 1:  0° (facing door/main entrance)
Photo 2:  18° (small turn left)
Photo 3:  36° (continue turning)
...
Photo 20: 342° (almost back to start)
```

#### What Each Photo Should Include
- **70% overlap** with previous photo
- **Multiple depths** - furniture, walls, floor visible
- **Good lighting** - avoid harsh shadows or bright windows
- **Sharp focus** - tap to focus on middle-distance objects
- **Room boundaries** - walls, ceiling, floor edges visible

## Advanced Technique: Multi-Height Capture

*For higher quality reconstruction*

### Level 1: Eye Level (Primary)
- 20 photos in circle at eye level (as above)

### Level 2: Coffee Table Height  
- 10 photos in circle at 3 feet height
- Focus on furniture details and floor textures

### Level 3: Near Ceiling
- 6 photos in circle at 7+ feet height
- Capture ceiling details and room overview

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
- **Random angles** - "I'll just take some photos around the room"
- **Too few photos** - "5 photos should be enough"  
- **Big jumps** - Moving across the room between shots
- **Portrait mode** - Vertical photos have less field of view
- **Blurry photos** - Moving while capturing
- **Backlit shots** - Pointing at bright windows

### ✅ DO THIS INSTEAD:
- **Systematic circle** - Consistent angular spacing
- **Enough photos** - 15-20 minimum, 30+ for complex rooms
- **Small movements** - Turn in place, don't walk
- **Landscape mode** - Horizontal orientation always
- **Sharp photos** - Hold steady, use burst mode if needed
- **Even lighting** - Close curtains, turn on room lights

## Room-Specific Guidelines

### Small Rooms (Bedrooms, Bathrooms)
- **12-15 photos minimum**
- **Stand closer to center** - 1-2 feet from middle
- **Include corners** - Make sure all 4 corners are captured
- **Watch for mirrors** - They can confuse the reconstruction

### Medium Rooms (Living Rooms, Kitchens)  
- **18-25 photos recommended**
- **Two circles** - One tight (2 feet from center), one wide (4 feet from center)
- **Include key furniture** - Couches, tables, cabinets from multiple angles

### Large Rooms (Open Plan, Conference Rooms)
- **25-35 photos needed**
- **Multiple positions** - Create 2-3 overlapping circles
- **Wide shots** - Step back to capture room boundaries
- **Detail shots** - Close-ups of important furniture/features

### Outdoor Spaces (Patios, Terraces)
- **30+ photos required**
- **Account for lighting** - Avoid harsh midday sun
- **Include boundaries** - Walls, fences, landscape features
- **Consider weather** - Consistent lighting throughout shoot

## Technical Requirements

### Camera Settings
- **Resolution**: Highest available (ideally 12MP+)
- **Focus**: Auto-focus enabled, tap to focus on mid-distance
- **Exposure**: Auto-exposure, but avoid extreme bright/dark areas
- **Flash**: OFF (ruins depth perception)
- **HDR**: ON if available (helps with high-contrast scenes)

### File Management
- **Naming**: Keep photos in capture order (IMG_001, IMG_002, etc.)
- **Format**: JPEG is fine, RAW if storage allows
- **Backup**: Save originals before processing

## Quality Check: Before Processing

Before running reconstruction, verify your photo set:

### Coverage Check
- [ ] Room completely captured (no major blind spots)
- [ ] All walls visible from multiple angles  
- [ ] Floor-to-ceiling coverage in most photos
- [ ] Key furniture captured from 3+ viewpoints

### Technical Check
- [ ] All photos sharp and well-lit
- [ ] Consistent exposure across the set
- [ ] 60-80% overlap between adjacent photos
- [ ] No major camera shake or motion blur

### Count Check
- [ ] **Minimum**: 15 photos for small rooms
- [ ] **Recommended**: 20-25 photos for most spaces
- [ ] **Complex spaces**: 30+ photos for large/complex rooms

## Troubleshooting Bad Results

### "Too few 3D points generated"
**Cause**: Not enough photo overlap  
**Fix**: Take more photos with higher overlap (80%+ instead of 60%)

### "Reconstruction failed completely"  
**Cause**: Photos too different from each other  
**Fix**: Reduce angular steps (12° instead of 18° between shots)

### "Points only in room center"
**Cause**: All photos focused on same area  
**Fix**: Include more wall/floor shots, vary distance from center

### "Blurry or low-quality reconstruction"
**Cause**: Poor photo quality or lighting  
**Fix**: Retake with better lighting, ensure all photos are sharp

## Quick Reference Card

**ESSENTIAL RULES:**
1. **20 photos minimum** in a systematic circle
2. **70% overlap** between adjacent photos
3. **Eye level, landscape orientation**
4. **Small angular steps** (15-20° between shots)
5. **Good lighting** throughout the room
6. **Sharp focus** on middle-distance objects

**SUCCESS FORMULA:**
```
More Photos + More Overlap = Better Reconstruction
```

Remember: It's better to take 30 good photos than 10 perfect ones!
